# Debrief Questions

  What emotions came up for you during the decision-making process—discomfort, frustration, detachment, guilt? What do those feelings reveal about your position in relation to refugee education?
  Did anything about your role in the game feel familiar—either from your personal or professional life? If so, how?
  What assumptions about refugees, policy, or education were challenged or reinforced during the game?
  How did the group dynamics impact your ability to advocate for certain policies? Were there moments when you chose silence or compromise? Why?
  Has your understanding of refugee education shifted from seeing it as a service “for them” to a system embedded in broader struggles over power, identity, and justice? If so, how?
  Whose interests did your decisions ultimately serve—refugees, citizens, or the state? Why?
  What power did you assume you had as a policymaker—and who did you imagine was absent or voiceless in that process?
  What compromises did you make for the sake of consensus, and who or what got erased in the process?
  How did the structure of the game (budget, options, scenario) shape or limit your imagination of justice?
  If refugee education wasn't about inclusion into existing systems—but about transforming those systems—what would that look like, and did your decisions move toward or away from that?
