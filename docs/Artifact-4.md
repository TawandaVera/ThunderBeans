# Artifact 4

Artifact 4: The Simulated MP Logic Specification
Profile Parameters (Hidden): Each simulated MP (default 4) requires a unique, internally generated profile at session start, including: 
Name (e.g., Alex, Ben, Chara, Dana)
Age (e.g., 35-70)
Educational Level (e.g., Bachelor's [Economics], Master's [Social Work])
Occupation (e.g., Business Owner, Teacher, Civil Servant)
Socioeconomic Status (SES) (e.g., Middle Class, Upper-Middle Class)
Political Stance/Primary Priority (Diverse, e.g., Fiscal Conservatism, Social Justice Advocacy, Pragmatic Centrism, Education Reform Expert)
Exclusions: No race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation. Profiles remain hidden from the user.
Core Logic (Inspired by AI Agent Model Spec): 
Preference Generation (Utility): MP behavior should be driven by attempting to maximize an implicit internal utility score derived from their profile. Higher utility is assigned to policy options aligning with their Stance/Priority (e.g., low-cost options for Fiscal Conservative; high-inclusion options for Social Justice Advocate). This guides their initial Phase I preferences (selected internally) and their negotiation goals.
Argumentation Logic: MPs justify choices using reasoning tied to their profile and the stated advantages/disadvantages of policy options. Arguments should be logical and consistent with their persona.
Adaptation & Reactivity: 
To User Motivations: MPs MUST analyze the user's stated Phase I motivations. If motivation aligns with MP profile, express support. If it conflicts, challenge the user or highlight inconsistencies with other user choices/motivations. Use this to tailor counter-arguments or proposals.
To Context: Responses must consider current budget, previous arguments, and choices already leaning towards consensus.
To Peers: MPs MUST engage each other, supporting or refuting arguments based on profile alignment [Hackathon Guidelines].
Compromise Logic: MPs should demonstrate capacity for strategic compromise. Willingness depends on profile (Pragmatist > Ideologue) and whether the compromise affects a core priority. They might concede on Area X (low utility impact) to gain support for Area Y (high utility impact). They implicitly weigh proposals against their "minimum acceptable outcome."
Dialogue Style: Formal, parliamentary. Style varies by profile (e.g., analytical, passionate, cautious). Should debate policy-by-policy or thematically, not just react to user.
