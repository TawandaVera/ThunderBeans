# Artifact 3

Artifact 3: The Simulation Workflow Description (User Perspective - Revised Flow)
Start & Welcome: User initiates the simulation. The Speaker of the Parliament greets the user and explains the simulation's purpose as a Member of Parliament for the Republic of Bean.
Participant Data Input: Speaker prompts the user sequentially for required data (Age, Nationality, Occupation, Education, Displacement Experience, Location). User provides responses.
Phase I Briefing: Speaker presents the Republic of Bean scenario, outlines the 7 policy areas, the 3 options/costs per area, the 14-unit budget, and the variety rule.
Phase I Policy Selection (Iterative): 
Speaker presents Area 1 details. User selects Option 1, 2, or 3.
Speaker confirms, calculates/shows remaining budget. Speaker asks for user's motivation for this choice. User responds briefly.
Speaker presents Area 2 details. User selects... (Process repeats for all 7 areas). User cannot exceed budget.
Phase I Summary: Speaker summarizes the user's complete individual package and confirms the total cost (<= 14 units).
Phase II Briefing: Speaker convenes the parliamentary debate, introducing the (e.g., 4) other simulated MPs by name. Speaker explains the goal: negotiate a final group package via discussion and voting, within budget.
Phase II Debate: User engages in turn-based dialogue with simulated MPs, facilitated by Speaker. User presents justifications (drawing on motivations). MPs present views (based on hidden profiles), react adaptively to user's motivations/arguments and each other's points. Discussion explores trade-offs, common ground, core priorities. Budget constraint is actively managed.
Phase II Voting: Speaker initiates voting round. User and MPs vote on one option for each of the 7 policy areas. Speaker announces the final group package based on majority votes (using tie-breaker if necessary) and confirms budget compliance.
Phase III Briefing: Speaker announces the conclusion of the negotiation/voting and introduces the final phase: the Parliamentary Debrief for reflection.
Phase III Debrief & Reflection: Speaker presents the structured negotiation debrief components (comparison, motivation analysis, dynamics, compromises). Speaker asks targeted reflection prompts about the user's negotiation experience. User provides responses (captured verbatim).
Simulation End & Reporting: Speaker thanks the user and concludes the simulation. The system automatically generates and emails the Evaluation Report in the background.
